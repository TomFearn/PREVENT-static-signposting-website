## Introduction 

Safeguide is my first assessed portfolio project developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp, consisting of learning outcomes to utilise HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap in order to fulfil the necessary requirements for the brief provided about PREVENT.

The live project can found here: <a href="" target="_blank">Astronauts for Autism</a>

## Project Outline

Safeguide is a fictional website for people living in Gloucestershire to be pointed to when looking for guidance on PREVENT.

### Key Objectives

- A responsive design
- Easy to navigate links to other resources
- clear easy to read layout

## UX Design

## User Stories 

As a concerned parent, I want to access information about the signs of radicalisation, so I can recognise potential risks and seek support early.

As a parent, I want to easily find additional resources to support my child knowing these will be similar to what they have already learned within the sessions to prevent confusion and frustration. 

As a teacher, I want to be able to quickly access a guide on how to recognise radicalisation in students, so I can take appropriate action if needed.

As a health professional, I want to have access to professional guidance on dealing with patients who might be showing signs of radicalisation, so I can support their well-being effectively.

As a member of the public, I want to learn about the PREVENT strategy and how I can contribute to stopping radicalization, so I can be part of the solution.

As a young person, I want to access a section where I can learn about the risks of radicalisation in a way that feels non-judgmental and helpful, so I can make informed choices.

As a social worker, I want to be able to quickly find resources for supporting at-risk individuals, so I can provide timely interventions.

As a law enforcement officer, I want to ensure the information on PREVENT is accurate and up to date.

As an employer I want to be able to be able to contact the sites authors.

## Colors
While color selection is important as the website is foucused on providing information user experience was prioritized over selecting a perfect color pallet.

To ensure compliance to standards, the [Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/) (also available as extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colour-contrast-checker/nmmjeclfkgjdomacpcflgdkgpphpmnfe)) was used.<br>

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to define the responsive layout of features.

### Responsive Design

Utilising media querias a responsive design was achieved. Many differing breakpoints had to be used to 

It took a lot of testing but I believe that I have made a page that is responsive to modern standards.
